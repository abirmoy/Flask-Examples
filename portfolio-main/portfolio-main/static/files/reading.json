However, I don't remember most of the stories in the book, and I wish I did, because they were all very interesting, but apart from making me feel great, and truly understanding that it takes solid hard work, luck, and the right time in history to invent something novel and useful, I don't remember many details. Making notes on things that strike a chord is the only way to make this a useful read. Otherwise, at this point, all I remember is it making me feel good after having read it.",

        "review": "Read 20% of it, and realized it is just another self help book that I can read to feel like I'm reading something smart, but until I don't actually apply anything in real life, it's as good as reading fiction. Something I really wish these books did was quiz you / give you situations to act out in, so you can learn to really see what you would do vs what the author is suggesting. Something of the sort of a school textbook with quizzes at the end of each chapter. I will try to finish it because it is a short book, but I find it hard to make it a useful read."

Else it's like reading a fiction book where you know the overall plot but you tend to forget the major details.\nSomething that really struck me is how hard it is to remove your biases, and to write from a neutral lens. For example, while speaking about a religion that has nothing to do with the Greek language, he often praises Greek, and describes the origin of an English word equating it back to the great Greeks - something that dilutes the importance of the actual religion being spoken about, almost placing the Greeks on top.",

It has all the elements of topics & interests I gravitate towards, am fond of, or have people around me speak about.\nIt has Black Mirror vibes, plotted similar to the movie Source Code, with philosophical questions we love asking ourselves about the paths not taken & big decisions that might have changed the course of our lives.\nFunnily enough, it also reminded me of a book series I loved as a child - The Magic Treehouse, which I thought was a hilarious parallel. All in all, I loved the concept, the hook, and the first half was especially fun to read - the end however was much like 'reading a Hollywood movie'."

I really enjoyed it because it read like a fiction book - based entirely on one man's recollection of his life events. And that's where I'd like to underscore the thing that stood out the most to me - much like a fiction book, the author is always _right_, because it is his story and he is the protagonist - given no matter what hardship, he comes out on top victorious. However, there are parts in the book where he says he hasn't done anything wrong/illegal, and yet you feel he isn't painting the entire picture. All in all though, this was a great motivational read!",

What I loved is how one of the most advanced pieces of technology we had in that day was the mechanical clock; and that's as far as the mind's imagination could go - the clockwork man is a cyborg who functions on advanced mechanical machinery, and the key to his functioning is a complicated clock at the back of its head (!!). The book feels like a lifetime compilation of the author's take on the various aspects of life, science and speculation of the future; the book has references to the greatness of Einstein, the understanding of time, the dimensions, love, emotions, relationships, scepticism, and belief. I loved it, and will definitely read this again as a book.",

But the idea of *getting* girls was still a major part of the book that really made me realize how cheap that sounds. I've never had such relationships before. They've always been built on months of getting to know each other and that's what I value."
